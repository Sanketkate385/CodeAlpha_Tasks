# CodeAlpha_Tasks

During my internship at CodeAlpha, I successfully developed three data-driven projects that deepened my expertise in machine learning and statistical analysis. For the Car Price Prediction project, I implemented the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, leveraging its ensemble learning capabilities to handle complex features like vehicle age and fuel type for highly accurate valuations. In the Sales Prediction task, I utilized Linear Regression to model the direct impact of advertising spends across various media channels on total revenue. Furthermore, I conducted an Unemployment Analysis using advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to interpret economic shifts and the specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience allowed me to master the end-to-end data science workflow, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation using Python.
